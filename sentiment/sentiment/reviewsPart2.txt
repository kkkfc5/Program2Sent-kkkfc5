FORMATTED REVIEW: 
An interesting local place with river views and good food in the moderate price 
range. It leans heavily toward sea food but there are menu items for the foul 
and bovine inclined. Reservations for diner are a must, particularly on Friday 
and Saturday or any day a popular show is appearing at the Count Basie Theatre. 
Two appetizers and two entrees with nonalcoholic drinks set us back $91 with 
tip. Fairly reasonable. We sat at a lovely set, uncomplicated, table with a 
beautiful view of the Navesink river and it's boat traffic. The service was 
polite, amiable and generally proficient about seeing to our needs. On this day 
I opened with the caprese salad which was very nicely done. The pesto was a 
tasty accent, not over powering. The wet mozzarella perfect and heirloom 
tomatoes glorious. They flavors coming together very nicely. My wife had an 
oyster dish that I'm having a senior moment trying to pull the name from memory, 
however it's sauce was delicious (I'm not a big oyster fan). I kept my entree 
simple: fish and chips. The fish was a nice thick piece of cod, not some cod 
replacement and fried to perfection. The fries were fries. :) My wife had the 
lobster roll, which she gave high marks. Overall a good place to dine before a 
show or after a late afternoon/ early evening walk about. It's not child adverse 
and a few dotted the tables while we were there but, at dinner at least, it runs 
toward an adult crowd. The parking can be difficult on popular show nights or 
Friday evening but the municipal lot is just across the street and you don't 
have to pay after 6pm. It's a thumbs up here.

Garon is undoubtedly the most welcoming and nice host ever. You feel at home 
right away, he is exciting and passionate, discussions are super interesting and 
he is extremely friendly. A stay at his place is a good mood cure. I highly 
recommend! It was so nice staying at Garon's! For the first glance it didn't 
look very fancy or something, but this place is gorgeous from inside out. It's 
pretty easy to get to subway G train or if you walk a little more you can get to 
A train which goes directly to JFK airport. Garon is a very kind person, very 
open-minded and friendly! We also have a lot in common in area of culture! I'll 
recommend this place to everyone who is open-minded and want to feel how people 
live there in NYC. Neighborhood looked safe. Despite it was one of the coldest 
weeks for last year in town, but heating worked well and the room was warm! "I 
had the most beautiful stay, Garon is a very special person and an absolute 
angel, made me feel totally at home in a highly peaceful and relaxed 
environment, I throughly recommend Bliss Art Space!

The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city. Truly 
a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty 
throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was amazing. This apartment 
is convenient and functional. The huge skylight makes it feel open and airy. And 
it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan. Highly recommended. Great 
place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet and easy going. 
Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer is a wonderful 
host and was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in. We loved the 
apartment! Jennifer's space was such a lovely experience. PreCheckin and checkin 
was detailed and seamless, she made it easier on us and answered all questions 
so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear & zen energy- we loved it. 
Not to mention it was very clean & close to everything! Definitely be prepared 
for the 4flight workout (we appreciated that)! We enjoyed the space and location 
& would recommend this to anyone coming to explore the city!! "Jennifer was 
super friendly and helpful. Great host with an amazing studio apartment right in 
the middle of NYC. Everything is walking distance! The Empire State Building, 
Times Square, and New York library were all around the corner or less than 15 
minutes walk. Best location ever and great relaxing place to stay.

The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city. Truly 
a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty

FORMATTED REVIEW: 
Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We 
spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 2012) 
and will remember this time as ours best. The apartment is pretty spacious and 
great located - the 5-th Ave right around the corner. There is everything you 
can need during your short or long stay. Jennifer is very friendly, vigorous and 
very responsible host. Thanks her and highly recomend this apartment for 
everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in the center of the boiling 
Midtown!" We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's charming apartment! They were 
very organized and helpful; I would definitely recommend staying at the Midtown 
Castle!
