Didn't know how to turn it in, so putting it in git and sending over the link


NOTE :: THE ONES WITH COPY ARE NOT THE FINAL VERS, THE FINAL VERSION OF "function.cpp" IS THE ONE LABELED SIMPLY "function.cpp"
         |  I am including the other vers so you can see the pain I went through. I have taken a c++ class before. I'd consider myself rather 
         |  well versed in the topics we are covering. You said the hard part was finding the original sentiment. Now, I don't know if
         |  I simply overengineered the solution (which, to be fair, is highly possible), but finding that was the *easy* part.
         |  I spent literal days worth of free time doing this. And I know that we had one week less, but still the difficulty spike
         |  from chocolate factory to this is incredible... the other students must be absolutely suffering, I'd be shocked if they 
         |  were able to finish this. Although, again, it could be that I overengineered the solution and it truly is much, much easier.
